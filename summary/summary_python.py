#this is my first python file:this is comment that is written using the hash symbol

#variable:this is a label that can be assigned a value
# 

#operators:these are symbols that perform operations on variables and values
#arithmetic operators:these are used to perform mathematical operations
# friends = 0
# friends = friends + 1
# friends += 1 #incrementing the value of friends by 1
# #friends = friends - 1 #decrementing the value of friends by 1
# #friends = friends * 2 #multiplying the value of friends by 2
# #friends = friends / 2 #dividing the value of friends by 2
# #friends = friends % 2 #modulus operator:returns the remainder of the division
# #friends = friends ** 2 #exponentiation operator:raises the value of friends to the power of 2
# #friends = friends // 2 #floor division operator:returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result

# print(friends) #output: 1
# #comparison operators:these are used to compare two values
#in built functions:these are functions that are built into python and can be used without importing any libraries
# x = 10
# y = 20
# print(x + y) #addition
# print(x - y) #subtraction
# print(x * y) #multiplication
# print(x / y) #division
# result = round(x / y, 2)  # rounding the result to 2 decimal places

#typecasting:converting one data type to another

# name ="phylis"
# age = 30
# gpa =1.9
# student = True
# print (f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, GPA: {gpa}, Student: {student}")

# age = str(age)  # converting age to string
# gpa = int(gpa)  # converting gpa to integer
# print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, GPA: {gpa}, Student: {student}")
#  round functuion

# rounding a number to 2 decimal places

# abs function:is used to get the absolute value of a number 

# import math
# print(math.pi)  # printing the value of pi

# print(math.e)  # printing the value of e
